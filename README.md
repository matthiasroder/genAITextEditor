# genAI Text Editor

This project is a web-based text editor that transforms user input text using OpenAI's GPT API. The editor allows you to input text outlines in one column and see the AI-generated text in another column. It includes an editable system prompt and instructions that guide the transformation process, as well as a feedback feature for improving your text.

## Features

- **Live Text Transformation**: As you type, your text is automatically transformed using the GPT API and displayed in a separate column.
- **Multi-Document Support**: Create, manage, and switch between multiple documents with seamless navigation.
- **Version Control**: Save, browse, and restore different versions of your document with automatic and manual saving options.
- **Cross-Window Collaboration**: Work on the same document in multiple browser windows with conflict resolution.
- **AI Feedback**: Receive feedback on your text as you write to help improve your content.
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Allows you to see your outline and the AI-generated text on the same page.
- **Custom Prompt**: Edit the transformation prompt to customize how your text is processed.
- **API Key Input**: Securely enter your OpenAI API key directly in the web interface.
- **Flexible Download Options**: Choose to download just the outlines, just the generated text, or both together.
